            <p class="m-2">Stefan Zweig wrote his long story Letter from an Unknown Woman (Brief einer Unbekannten) in the first half of the 1920s. We only know the heroine of Letter from an Unknown Woman as the author of a long letter. The "sender" of this letter, which the woman wrote for the man she loved all her life, has no name. At the beginning of the letter there is only one address: "To you, who never knew me". The woman is always willing to live her great passion as an "unknown", that is, alone, there is only one "side" in this love story, not "sides". Can this be called true love? Zweig invites his readers, once again, to an unprecedented journey in human psychology. It is also possible that at the end of this new journey, he aimed to reach the hitherto unknown shores of the concept of "absolute love"!</p>

            <p class="m-2">Educator and writer Ömer Açık, who is very popular with his powerful narrative, tells a philosophical story that stretches from school corridors to life in his third novel. Questioning the frequently used alphabetical order, the novel draws attention with its surprising plot. Reminding the forgotten power of the word, the author opens to discussion important concepts such as justice, freedom and solidarity in the company of realistic characters who are far from violence. Ömer Açık's latest novel appeals to readers of all ages, whose children's books called Menekşe Station and My Father is Lifetime Man, in which he tells the stories of the hopeful neighborhood, are read with pleasure.</p>

            <p class="m-2">“Every heartbeat had a story.” When Bestegül left home to go to school that morning, as she does every morning, she did not yet know that her destiny would meet with thirteen other people. He got on the subway that morning and traveled to the last stop, but could not get out of the last stop. He and thirteen others were stranded in the subway station with him, and at that moment the first heartbeat of their shared story went deafening. They had things to contend with under the rubble. Hunger, thirst, longing, grief, sadness, death... While their hearts were beating with fear, one of them died suddenly and the others followed him one by one for interesting reasons. While all these deaths left deep scars on their hearts and brains, all they could do was wait to be rescued from the rubble. Now one of us will get out of here, get out of here. He'll take the photos we've taken and put them in a frame, hang the frame on a wall, and watch us in front of him. Time will freeze at that moment. Now one of us will survive but his left will be dead. One of us will grow old in a frame hung on one's wall. For one of us the song will end, but we will both stop dancing. Do you understand? You do not understand. Because you stopped hearing me. Anyway, I talk too.</p>
